# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm James.

I'm an MSc Applied Data Science with Statistics student and BSc Mathematics graduate from the University of Exeter. I enjoy working on data-driven problems that sit at the intersection of statistics, machine learning, and real-world impact.

Most of my work is in **R** (my primary language), but I also have experience in **Python** and **MATLAB**. My background includes everything from modelling disease risk across Brazil using **Generalised Additive Models**, to applying **Bayesian inference** to understand cognitive function in schizophrenia. I like using data to uncover structure, communicate clearly, and build insights that actually inform decisions.

Right now, Iâ€™m working on my MSc thesis â€” building a survey-weighted, regression-based model using NHANES data to explore how muscle mass influences diabetes risk after adjusting for body composition and lifestyle factors.

Outside of academics, I independently built a YouTube channel with over 6.5 million views and 64k subscribers, where I developed skills in analytics, audience insight, and content strategy â€” all of which inform how I approach storytelling in data science.

## ðŸ”¬ Featured Projects

### ðŸ§ª [Quantifying Tuberculosis Risk in Brazil Using GAMs](https://github.com/frostbyte-ds/tb-gam-brazil)
A spatial epidemiology project using Generalised Additive Models (GAMs) in R to model TB risk across 557 Brazilian microregions. Includes spatial smooths, model selection, and ggplot-based visualisations.

### ðŸ§  [Bayesian Inference of Cognitive Function in Schizophrenia & Machine Learning Classification](https://github.com/frostbyte-ds/bayesian-and-classification)
A two-part statistical modeling project in R:
Part 1: Applied Bayesian inference using a two-component mixture model (via JAGS) to disentangle motor retardation and attention deficit effects on reaction times in schizophrenic patients.
Part 2: Implemented and compared QDA, KNN, SVM, and Random Forest classifiers on a separate binary classification task using cross-validation and performance metrics (accuracy, sensitivity, specificity).
